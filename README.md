### General Info

This project created a cool wave effect to each letter of an array. I learned how to use the split method on a string to create an array composed of each individual letter. Then I used the map method to run an arrow function on each item in the array; wrapping each letter in a span with, and using the style attribute to add a transition delay. Lastly I used the join method to convert that array back to a string to be shown.
